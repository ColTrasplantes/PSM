# Explanation:
# This table provides a snapshot of the matched dataset, displaying the propensity scores and selected covariates.
# It allows us to see how patients are matched based on their propensity scores and to verify the distribution of key covariates.
# The "propensity_score" column shows the estimated probability of receiving a transplant based on the covariates.
# The other columns show the key variables that were used in the matching process.

# Additional Balance Assessment with Visual Tools
# To further validate the matching process, additional visual tools are used.

plot(matchit_result, type = 'hist')   # Histogram plots show the distribution of propensity scores across matched groups.
plot(matchit_result, type = 'qq')     # QQ plots compare the distribution of covariates before and after matching.

# Interpretation:
# The jitter plot should show a good overlap in the distribution of propensity scores between the treatment and control groups, indicating successful matching.
# The histogram should demonstrate a more uniform distribution of propensity scores across groups after matching.
# The QQ plot provides a visual check for the distributional similarity of covariates before and after matching.

# Sensitivity Analysis
## Sensitivity analysis tests the robustness of the matching process by varying the caliper width and trying different matching methods.
## This step is crucial to ensure that the results are not overly dependent on the specific parameters chosen for the matching process.

# Varying the caliper width
caliper_values <- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.15)
sensitivity_results <- list()

for (caliper in caliper_values) {
  matchit_result_sensitivity <- matchit(Transplant_Y_N ~ ., data = data_filtered, method = "nearest", caliper = caliper)
  matched_data_sensitivity <- match.data(matchit_result_sensitivity)
  reg_sensitivity <- glm(Transplant_Y_N ~ diabetes, data = matched_data_sensitivity, family = binomial)
  sensitivity_results[[paste0("Caliper_", caliper)]] <- summary(reg_sensitivity)
}

# Print sensitivity results
for (result in names(sensitivity_results)) {
  print(result)
  print(sensitivity_results[[result]])
}

# Interpretation:
## By examining the results at different caliper widths, you can assess whether the matching process remains robust under different assumptions.
## Significant changes in the results across different caliper values might indicate that the matching process is sensitive to the choice of caliper, which could affect the reliability of the findings.
```


```{r}
# Sensitivity Analysis with Different Matching Methods
# This section tests the robustness of the propensity score matching process by trying different matching methods.
# The objective is to see if the results remain consistent across various matching techniques, which would indicate that the findings are robust and not overly dependent on the choice of the matching method.

# Different matching methods to be tested: "nearest", "optimal", "full"
#matching_methods <- c("nearest", "optimal", "full")
#sensitivity_results_methods <- list()

# Loop through each matching method, perform matching, and then run a logistic regression on the matched data
#for (method in matching_methods) {
#  matchit_result_method <- matchit(Transplant_Y_N ~ ., data = data_filtered, method = method)
#  matched_data_method <- match.data(matchit_result_method)
#  reg_method <- glm(Transplant_Y_N ~ diabetes, data = matched_data_method, family = binomial)
#  sensitivity_results_methods[[method]] <- summary(reg_method)
#}

# Print sensitivity results for different methods
#for (result in names(sensitivity_results_methods)) {
#  print(result)
#  print(sensitivity_results_methods[[result]])
#}

# Interpretation:
# This sensitivity analysis compares how different matching methods (nearest, optimal, full) impact the results.
# - **Nearest Neighbor Matching:** Pairs treated units with the closest control units based on propensity score.
# - **Optimal Matching:** Minimizes the overall distance between matched pairs across the entire sample.
# - **Full Matching:** Forms matched sets with one or more treated and control units, offering the most flexibility.

# Consistent results across methods indicate that the findings are robust and not dependent on the specific matching method.
# If the estimated effect of diabetes remains stable across methods, the conclusions are reliable.
# Significant variability across methods suggests the matching method might influence the outcome, warranting further investigation.

```


```{r}
# Outcome Analysis after Matching
## Finally, after confirming that the matching process has balanced the covariates, a logistic regression model is fitted to analyze the effect of diabetes on the likelihood of receiving a transplant, now using the matched dataset.
reg_after <- glm(Transplant_Y_N ~ diabetes, data = matched_data, family = binomial)
summary(reg_after)

# Interpretation:
## The regression results before matching showed a significant association between diabetes and the likelihood of receiving a transplant (p < 0.001). 
## However, after matching, this association was no longer significant (p = 0.842), with an odds ratio close to 1.
## This suggests that the initial association was likely confounded by other factors, which were successfully controlled for by the matching process. 
## As a result, the effect of diabetes on receiving a transplant appears to be negligible when accounting for these confounders, 
## leading to more reliable causal inferences. The matching process has effectively balanced the covariates, reducing bias and providing a clearer understanding of the true effect of diabetes on transplant likelihood.
